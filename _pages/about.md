- **Research Assistant** at the [GraalVM Team](https://www.graalvm.org/) at [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/)
- **PhD Student** at the [VeriFIT Research Group](https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/group/verifit/.en) at [FIT BUT](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en)

My main interests are **programming language design, analysis, and implementation**. I'm interested in and fascinated about the whole infrastructure that _allows us to write efficient programs efficiently_ ranging from compilers, interpreters, virtual machines, and static analysis tools all the way to IDEs and tooling.

In my PhD, I focus on _improving closed-world ahead-of-time compilation using static analysis_.

I've been contributing for several years to the [Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) ahead-of-time Java compiler, mainly in the area of _static analysis_.

Apart from compilers, I'm also interested in _algorithmic problem solving_. I regularly solve tasks at [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/dkozak94/) as an exercise and I also enjoy participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
