I am fortunate enough to base my research on a real world industry ready virtual machine. In particular, my research aims at improving the static analysis used in [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/), which is an ahead-of-time compiler for Java. 

My first paper was about speeding up Native Image compilation with a faster analysis {% cite mplr23 %} and now we have a few other papers on the go, which should hopefully appear here shortly.
